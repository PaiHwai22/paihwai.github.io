### Competition Experience
(2023)
[Ernst and Young Data Science Competition in collaboration with Microsoft and Cornell](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/past/level-1-crop-identification-global?id=637e2d535712cf0015c7691f)
- ** Level 1: Crop Identification **
  
  Placing 4th in Singapore Region, our 2 person team built a 94% high accuracy AI Machine Learning Model to identify areas where rice is cultivated.
  We built our own CNN model and radar data to create heat maps and classifiers, along with time series over cropping cycles that iterated over the seasons. 

- ** Level 2: Yield Estimation **
- 
  Placing 6th in Singapore Region, I led my team in building a regressor model, to help scientists better understand the impact of climate change on crop yields.
  We used data from Microsoft Planetary Computer to access Sentinel-1 (radar), Sentinel-2 (optical), and Landsat data (optical). The model is purposed to forcast
  yield for any identified area of crop region.
